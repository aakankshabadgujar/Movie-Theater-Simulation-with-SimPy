# Movie-Theater-Simulation-with-SimPy
# Description
This project simulates the average wait times of customers in a movie theater using SimPy. The simulation takes into account various factors such as the availability of cashiers, servers, and ticket checkers. The goal is to model the theater's operation and determine how these factors affect customer wait times.
# Features
Simulation Environment: Utilizes SimPy to create a realistic simulation environment.

Customer Interaction: Models customer interactions with cashiers, servers, and ticket checkers.

Randomized Events: Incorporates randomness in service times and server availability.

Wait Time Calculation: Calculates and displays the average wait time for customers.

# Usage
Modify the simulation parameters (e.g., number of cashiers, servers, ticket checkers) as needed.

Run the simulation to see how different configurations affect customer wait times.

Analyze the output to optimize theater operations.
