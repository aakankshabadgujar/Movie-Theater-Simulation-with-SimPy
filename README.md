# Movie-Theater-Simulation-with-SimPy
This project simulates the average wait times of customers in a movie theater using SimPy. The simulation takes into account various factors such as the availability of cashiers, servers, and ticket checkers. The goal is to model the theater's operation and determine how these factors affect customer wait times.
